# `My 4 Favorite Ruby Methods`

### ``yield``
  You can do something, but you don't know what it is doing, but it works... sorta
  ```
  x = 0
  while x < 1
    yield
    x += 1
    end

  ```


### `detect`
  You can detect that this might be useful
  ```
  useful.detect(is_it?) = false
  ```


### `until`
  Always useful until its not
  ```
  until x==useful
    do |useful|
      x = useful
      end
  end
  ```



### `each`
  helpful unless you need something, then you should have mapped
  ```
  array.each
```
